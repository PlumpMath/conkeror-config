My cofiguration files for [conkeror](http://conkeror.org/).

Although it is possible to make `~/.conkerorrc` a directory (and that's
what all people do if they separate config into multiple files), I
prefer another way.  My `~/.conkerorrc` is a symlink to
[init.js](https://github.com/alezost/conkerorrc/blob/master/init.js) and
this file loads the other files I need in the order I want.
